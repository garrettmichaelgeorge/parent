# 0.12.0

## Breaking changes

- A child which times out (according to its `:timeout` setting) is terminated according to its shutdown specification, using the `:timeout` exit reason for non-forceful termination. Previously timed out children were always forcefully terminated.

## Bug fixes

- Correctly takes down anonymous bound siblings of an anonymous child

# 0.11.2

- Properly cleans up stopped child from the internal state
- Correctly updates bindings when a non-ephemeral child stops

# 0.11.1

- Fixes a crash in `Parent.child_spec/1`

# 0.11.0

## Sumary

This version adds the remaining of the `Supervisor` behaviour to `Parent`, such as automatic child restarts, self-termination when maximum restart intensity is exceeded, and binding lifecycles of children. The new module `Parent.Supervisor` provides the highest-level interface, roughly comparable to a callbackless `Supervisor`. However, all of the parenting features are available in lower level modules, `Parent.GenServer` (which is similar to a callback-based `Supervisor` + `GenServer`) and `Parent` (which can be thought of as a toolkit for building custom parent behaviours and processes). The new module `Parent.Client` can be used to interact with any parent process from the outside (i.e. from other processes).

Beyond just mirroring supervisor functionality, `Parent` explores some different approaches, most notably:

- There are no supervision strategies. Instead, the options `:binds_to` and `:shutdown_group` can be used to bind lifecycles of children.
- There's no per-parent distinction between static and dynamic (aka `:simple_one_for_one` or `DynamicSupervisor`) parents. The same process can be used to parent both static and dynamic children, using the per-child `:ephemeral?` setting to control the behaviour for each child.
- Parent supports fine-grained children discovery, and the optional `:registry?` option for exposing children info via an ETS table.

As a result, `Parent` can help in flattening and simplifying the supervision tree. Refer to documentation for more details, starting with the README page for a quick showcase, and the `Parent` module docs for a detailed reference.

## Breaking changes

- Requires Elixir 1.10+
- Callback `GenServer.handle_child_terminated` has been renamed to `GenServer.handle_stopped_children`. In addition, the callback now receives only two arguments. Refer to documentation for details.
- Children are by default permanent and non-ephemeral, which changes the behaviour compared to previous versions. To retain the previous behaviour, include `restart: :temporary, ephemeral?: true` in a childspec of every child. See `Parent` documentation for details.
- `Parent.await_child_termination/2` is removed.
- Return type of functions `Parent.children/0`, `Parent.handle_message/1`, `Parent.shutdown_child/1`, `Parent.restart_child/1` has changed. See `Parent` documentation for details.
- Previously deprecated `Parent.GenServer` functions are removed. You can use `Parent.Client` functions instead.

## Additions

- Support for automatic restarts of children via the `:restart` option, and maximum restart intensity via the `:max_restarts` option.
- Support for ephemeral children, which allows a per-child control of static/dynamic supervision behaviour.
- Support for binding children lifecycles via options `:binds_to` and `:shutdown_group`.
- Parent can act as an ETS-based registry using the `registry?: true` parent option.
- Added `Parent.Supervisor`, which provides a high-level supervisor-like functionality.
- Added `Parent.Client`, which provides API for interacting with parent processes from the outside.

# 0.11.0-rc.1

When restarting a child, parent will unconditionally restart all the siblings bound to it (directly or transitively), irrespective of their restart strategy.

This version introduces the concept of ephemeral children, through the `:ephemeral?` flag in child specification. This flag controls how a parent manages non-running children, which is a state a child can enter if the child's start function returns `:ignore`, if a transient child terminates normally, or if a temporary child terminates.

If a child is not ephemeral (default), the parent will still keep the child in its internal state, and the non-running child will appear in the result of functions such as `Parent.children/0` with its pid set to `:undefined`. This mimics the behaviour of "static" (one_for_one, one_for_all, rest_for_one) supervisors.

If a child is ephemeral (`ephemeral?: true`), the parent will remove the child from its state when the child is not running. This mimics the behaviour of `DynamicSupervisor`.

## Breaking changes

- Temporary, transient, and non-running children are restarted if the process they depend on is being restarted by the parent.
- Non-running children will by default remain in the parent's state. If you use parent to dynamically start temporary children, you should make your children ephemeral by including `ephemeral?: true` in the childspec.
- `Parent.GenServer.handle_stopped_children` is not invoked for non-ephemeral children. If you rely on this callback, you need to make the children ephemeral.

## Additions

- Support for ephemeral children, which allows a per-child control of static/dynamic supervision behaviour.

To change this, set the child as ephemeral

# 0.11.0-rc.0

This version adds the remaining of the `Supervisor` behaviour to `Parent`, such as automatic child restarts, self-termination when maximum restart intensity is exceeded, and binding lifecycles of children. The new high-level module `Parent.Supervisor` provides the highest-level interface, roughly comparable to a callbackless `Supervisor`. However, all of the parenting features are available in lower level modules, `Parent.GenServer` (which is similar to a callback-based `Supervisor` + `GenServer`) and `Parent` (which can be thought of as a toolkit for building custom parent behaviours and processes). The new module `Parent.Client` can be used to interact with any parent process from the outside (i.e. from other processes).

Beyond just mirroring supervisor functionality, `Parent` explores some different approaches, most notably:

- There are no supervision strategies. Instead, the options `:binds_to` and `:shutdown_group` can be used to bind lifecycles of children.
- There's no special option for controlling dynamic mode (aka `:simple_one_for_one` or `DynamicSupervisor`). In the vast majority of cases the usage is exactly the same, and you can easily combine statical and dynamical children under the same supervisor.
- Parent supports more fine-grained children discovery, and an optional `:registry?` option for exposing children info via ETS table.

As a result, `Parent` can help in flattening and simplifying the supervision tree.

Refer to documentation for more details.

# 0.10.0

- **[Deprecation]** - all `Parent.GenServer` functions except for `start_link` have been deprecated. Use equivalent functions from the `Parent` module instead.
- The `Parent` module which provides plumbing for building custom parent processes and behaviours is now included in the public API.

# 0.9.0

- `Parent.GenServer` terminates children synchronously, in the reverse start order. The same change holds for `shutdown_all/1`.

# 0.8.0

## Periodic

- Improved support for custom scheduling via the `:when` option.
- Simplified synchronous testing via `Periodic.sync_tick/2`.

### The `:when` option

The `:when` option assists the implementation of custom schedulers. For example, let's say we want to run a job once a day at midnight. In previous version, the suggested approach was as follows:

```elixir
Periodic.start_link(
  every: :timer.minutes(1),
  run: fn ->
    with %Time{hour: 0, minute: 0} <- Time.utc_now(),
      do: run_job()
  end
)
```

Note that with this approach we're actually starting a new job process every minute, and making a decision in that process. The problem here is that telemetry events and log entries will be emitted once every minute, instead of just once per day, which will lead to a lot of unwanted noise. Consequently, with this approach some parts of `Periodic` (telemetry, logging, handling of overlapping jobs) become useless.

The `:when` option can help us here. Let's see the usage first. The previous example can be rewritten as:

```elixir
Periodic.start_link(
  every: :timer.minutes(1),
  when: fn -> match?(%Time{hour: 0, minute: 0}, Time.utc_now()) end,
  run: &run_job/0
)
```

Unlike a custom check executed in the job, the `:when` function is invoked inside the scheduler process. If the function returns `false`, the job won't be started at all. As a result, all the features of `Periodic`, including telemetry and logging, will work exactly as expected. For example, telemetry events will only be emitted at midnight.

### Synchronous manual ticking

Previously `Periodic.Test` exposed the `tick/1` function which allowed clients to manually tick the scheduler. The problem here was that `tick` would return before the job finished, so client code needed to perform a sequence of steps to test the scheduler:

1. Provide the telemetry id
2. Setup telemetry handler in the test
3. Invoke `tick/1`
4. Invoke `assert_periodic_event(telemetry_id, :finished, %{reason: :normal})` to wait for the job to finish, and assert that it hasn't crashed.

The new `sync_tick` function turns this into a single step:

```elixir
assert Periodic.Test.sync_tick(pid_or_registered_name) == {:ok, :normal}
```

# 0.7.0

## Periodic

- **[Breaking]** The options `:log_level` and `:log_meta` are not supported anymore. Logging is done via telemetry and the provided `Periodic.Logger`.
- **[Breaking]** The value `:infinity` isn't accepted for the options `:every` and `:initial_delay` anynmore. Instead, if you want to avoid running the job in test environment, set the `:mode` option to `:manual`.
- Telemetry events are now emitted. The new module `Periodic.Logger` can be used to log these events.
- Added `Periodic.Test` to support deterministic testing of periodic jobs.
- Scheduler process can be registered via the `:name` option.
- Default job shutdown is changed to 5 seconds (from `:brutal_kill`), and can now be configured via the `:job_shutdown` option. This allows polite termination (the parent of the scheduler process will wait until the job is done).
- Scheduling is now based on absolute monotonic time, which reduces the chance of clock skew in regular delay mode.
- Documentation is thoroughly reworked. Check it out [here](https://hexdocs.pm/parent/Periodic.html#content).
